# Advanced-Clustering-Analysis-on-Mental-Health-Profiles
This project applies advanced clustering techniques to analyze mental health profiles using the Mental Health and Client Level dataset (MH-CLD) provided by The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Our goal is to identify distinct mental health profiles, understand the relationships between demographic factors and mental health diagnoses, and assess their impact on each other.

## Dataset

The dataset MH-CLD-2021-DS0001-bndl-data-csv_v1.csv is a comprehensive collection of variables related to mental health diagnoses and demographic information. The dataset is cleaned by eliminating rows having missing values. Handbook is provided to understand the terminology.
